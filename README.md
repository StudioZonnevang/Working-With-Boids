# Working-With-Boids

Here you can find the project file of the Working With Boids application

For those who are not familiar with the project: 
I started this project based on a Youtube video on boids by Sebastian Lague, 
I wanted to understand the theory behind boids too, 
so I took the files provided by Sebastian to see if I could make any sense of them. 
The project has been a learning experience for me as I achieved a better understanding 
of boids and the general pipeline of working with Unity. I ended up creating a "playable" experience.
